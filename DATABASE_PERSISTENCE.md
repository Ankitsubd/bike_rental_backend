# Database Persistence Guide

## **🔧 Problem Solved:**
Your bikes were reappearing because the SQLite database was being reset on every Vercel deploy.

## **✅ Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Persistent Database Setup**
- Database file persists across deployments
- Only runs migrations if database doesn't exist
- Prevents data loss on deploys

### **2. Backup System**
```bash
# Create backup
python backup_db.py backup

# List backups
python backup_db.py list

# Restore from backup
python backup_db.py restore db_backup_20250803_135629.sqlite3

# Check database health
python backup_db.py check
```

### **3. How It Works Now:**

#### **Before (Problem):**
```
1. Delete bikes from production ✅
2. Push to GitHub ✅
3. Vercel rebuilds app ✅
4. Database gets reset ❌
5. Bikes reappear ❌
```

#### **After (Solution):**
```
1. Delete bikes from production ✅
2. Push to GitHub ✅
3. Vercel rebuilds app ✅
4. Database persists ✅
5. Bikes stay deleted ✅
```

## **🚀 Deployment Process:**

### **First Time Setup:**
1. Deploy to Render
2. Database will be created automatically
3. Add initial data through admin

### **Regular Updates:**
1. Make code changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Render rebuilds automatically
4. Database persists unchanged

### **If Database Gets Corrupted:**
1. Create backup: `python backup_db.py backup`
2. Restore from backup: `python backup_db.py restore <filename>`
3. Deploy again

## **📊 Database Status:**
- **Type:** SQLite (persistent)
- **Location:** `db.sqlite3` in production
- **Backups:** Stored in `backups/` directory
- **Health Check:** `python backup_db.py check`

## **⚠️ Important Notes:**

### **Backup Before Major Changes:**
```bash
python backup_db.py backup
```

### **Check Database Health:**
```bash
python backup_db.py check
```

### **If Bikes Still Reappear:**
1. Check if database file exists in production
2. Verify backup system is working
3. Contact support if persistent

## **🎯 Result:**
**Your deleted bikes will now stay deleted after pushing to GitHub!** ✅
